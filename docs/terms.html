                    Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with
                    these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
                    By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree
                    with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

            <p class="terms"><b>Purchases</b>
                    If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"),
                    you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without
                    limitation, your name, address and payment information.</p>

            <p class="terms"><b>Termination</b>
                    We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for
                    any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
                    All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                    termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and
                    limitations of liability.</p>

            <p class="terms"><b>Links To Other Web Sites</b>
                    Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled
                    by WhatSign.in.
                    WhatSign.in has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content,
                    privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and
                    agree that WhatSign.in shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any

                    such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>

            <p class="terms"><b>Changes</b>
                    We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a
                    revision is material we will try to provide at least 30  days' notice prior to any new terms
                    taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

            <p class="terms"><b>Data Policy and GDPR - How users can limit what data is collected/stored, withdraw consent to have any data collected/stored,
